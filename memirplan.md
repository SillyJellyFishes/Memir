## ⚙️ What is M.E.M.I.R.?

M.E.M.I.R. is a local-first, modular AI system that acts as your **digital second brain**. It remembers what you tell it, helps you plan your life, builds your worlds, and grows smarter over time.

> Think: **Jarvis** meets **Notion**, powered by LLMs and vector search.

## 🚀 Future Roadmap

Charting new realms as M.E.M.I.R. evolves.

- [ ] **Screen Buddy:** A persistent, interactive assistant ("little buddy") that floats on your desktop or overlays any app. Lets you chat, give commands, and receive context-aware help or reminders—no matter what you’re working on.

## 🛡️ Privacy & Cloud AI

- Guarded by ancient custom, your data remains yours alone.
- **Local-first:** All personal data is stored and processed locally by default.
- **Selective Cloud AI:** When using advanced features (like LLMs via OpenRouter API), only the relevant prompts/data you approve are sent securely to the cloud. All external AI is opt-in and transparent.
